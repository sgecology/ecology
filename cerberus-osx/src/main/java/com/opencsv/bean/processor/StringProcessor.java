 * This is the interface for validators for a single

 * <p>This can be used when modifying the setter of the bean is not possible.</p>
 * <p>WARNING - using a processor can change the string in ways that could make
 * it impossible to be processed or make it into a different format than what
 * you are expecting based on the settings of the parser and reader. So great
 * care must be taken when creating and using a StringProcessor.</p>
 * <p>NOTE - Because of the potential problems a bad processor can cause we
 * will close down any bug reports created for opencsv where a StringProcessor is
 * involved with the recommendation they be reopened as a support request.</p>
